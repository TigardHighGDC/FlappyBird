# Unity Flappy Bird

This repository contains various examples of how the Tigard High School Game Development Club strives to build and review entire
worlds using the Unity game engine. The goal is always to build a game from scratch, using a variety of tools and resources
to learn, grow and have fun as a team.

This repository was developed before the 2022-2023 OGPC season theme was announced by team Unitatum Ludus.
